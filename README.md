This is a forum GRPC server which you can use to develop your own forum. You should create your API gateway in order to use it.

## Getting Started

You need to develop a backend client to communicate with this microservice. The client should communicate with this microservice using GRPC protocol.

In order to make it easier, we've created some tutorials:

* [Easiest way to use msforum-grpc on your NodeJS software](./README.md)
* [Node client for msforum-grpc](./README.md)
* [NestJS API Gateway example](./README.md)
